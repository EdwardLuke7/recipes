Ingredients:
  For the pancake mixture:
   - 110g/4oz plain flour, sifted
   - pinch of salt
   - 2 eggs
   - 200ml/7fl oz milk mixed with 75ml/3fl oz water
   - 50g/2oz butter

  To serve:
    - caster sugar
    - lemon juice 
    - lemon wedges

Direction:
    1. Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl so the flour gets an airing. Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs - any sort of whisk or even a fork will do - incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so.

    2. Cook them.
